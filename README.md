# New-Jersey-vs-Quebec-2018-2024
For  Birth, Death &amp; Aging Trends
Data sources: census.gov and statistique.quebec.ca

"Tableau" data come from Québec.

"sc-est" data come from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The year 2020 provides a crude calculation (April 1, 2020 Census count--2020 is decennial census year), 
Since federal (U.S.) and state (New Jersey) data are consistent, I used NJSHAD for calculating both birth and death rates.

PROC TRANSPOSE was required to prepare the cleaned data for visualization in Tableau BI and Power BI.

Tableau BI only required a single pivot.

INDEX and INPUT–PUT functions were used for data formatting and validation.

Final: Quebecs death rate is higher than its birth
